2D RPG for IB personal project
This was created as a project for the IB personal project in 10th grade. This was mostly a project I started to learn Java, so that I had an eventual goal 
while learning the language. I would reccomend you always plan out projects in advance, as I learned from how messy and unorganized my code became. I would also reccomend
more detailed comments, so that when you come back to something you can remember how it works. It also challenged my problem solving skills by forcing me to derive an algorithm
for a game engine, which would not have been possible without research. Overall it was a fun experience and I hope to return to it one day, maybe making a platformer instead of 
an RPG, or recruiting someone to do the art for me.
